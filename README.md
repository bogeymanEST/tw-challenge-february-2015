# TransferWise Challenge 2015: qcharge
Project description:
qcharge is a webapp designed to make daily transactions as smooth as possible
qcharge implements stripe to remember your payment information for your transactions,
which means you will only have to set it up your payment information once.

If you are a vendor using qcharge when you need to start a transaction,
all you have to do is generate the QR code and have the customer scan in the QR code and confirm the payment.
You will be notified on your device once the transaction has been completed

If you are paying with qcharge, you use a QR code reading app to get the payment link and then simply confirm the payment via stripe, fast and easy. 

This working prototype was developed by team DontTouchMeWhenImCoding for the second TransferWise challenge.
