####This is the place to tell us how you are going to measure your _awesomeness_

The website is basically divided into 3 main parts.
First: the part meant for the recipient.
Second: the part meant for the first-time user
Third: the part meant for the registered user.

Firstly we need to measure the most important metric - the success rate.
  >>Success rate
  
  How - We count the number of transactions, which have NOT failed or have cancelled aka has made it to the end, and we then   divide it by the number of transactions which have both succeeded or failed.

  Measuring how well is our product doing

  >>Registration conversion rate
  
  How - We take the number of registered users and divide that number with the number of unique visits to the website (unique   meaning first-time visits)

  Measuring how well and easy is getting new users to sign up

  >>Different webpage failure rate
  
  How -  Basically we put all the pages we have ( all twelve of them ) to a table with the number of times people have quit   or cancelled their transaction while on this particular page.

  Measuring what pages cause the most failures gives us an idea what needs fixing.

  >>Regular user rate

  How - A user that uses the website atleast once every 30 days is a regular user. So we take the number of regural user and   divide that number with the number of total users.

  Measuring how much do users use the website constantly, giving us an idea how well we sell the idea and convenience of the   website.

  User activity rate
  
  How - We have a separate table which records times when users use the website.

  We measure when is the website used the most often (day or night;holidays or workdays; etc)
